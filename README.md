âœ¨ HR Analytics Dashboard on Attrition Analysis âœ¨

I just completed an insightful project focusing on attrition analysis, where I explored employee trends using key metrics such as count, age distribution, salary ranges, and more â€” all while adding my personal touch to the formatting! ðŸ’¼ðŸ“Š

Key insights include:
âœ… Attrition Rate: 16.2%
âœ… Age Group Trends: Majority between 26-35 years
âœ… Education Field Breakdown: Life Sciences leads with 41%
âœ… Salary Ranges by Attrition: Detailed comparison by gender

This project, initially guided by Rishabh Mishra , was an exciting experience to work on and refine further with Power BI. Loving every bit of this analytics journey! ðŸ’ª
